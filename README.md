# Basys3-LFSR-Project
Basys3 LFSR

In this project, I created a LFSR on a basys3 FPGA board that produces a pseudo-random output to the 7 segment display. The code to "unlock" this LFSR is a simple 9's complement input from the on-board switches. The project required a combination of the 7-segment display module, button debouncer, a series of D Flip Flops in order to create the pseudo-random number, and a 2-bit counter that provides the output to be decoded.
